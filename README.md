# cs3114-project-spec
The project specs for CS3114 projects are very convoluted, and I find are often missing crucial information
that can only be found in-class, or through asking the right TAs the right questions.

This repository tries to mitigate this.
Making the project spec much easier to parse and find requirements.

If additional critical information is discovered that is not in the specs,
I welcome you to make a pull request that includes the information in a simple-to-read way,
or you can simply open an issue with the information,
and someone else can summarize the data.
